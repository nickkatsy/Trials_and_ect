These are projects that are not fully completed. Some of this code was heavly influnced by others. I do not claim 100% percent ownership for all of the code in this repository.
If you wrote this code and feel that I took way too much of your work, let me know and I will take it down.
If I did heavily plagarize your work, it was unintentional and I am sorry. In this repo "Trials_and_ect", I am trying techniques that I am not fully accustomed to yet.
